# NexusQ
NexusQ: Distributed Task Queue
NexusQ is a high-throughput, distributed task queue system designed for asynchronous job processing. Built with Java, Apache Kafka, and Redis, it ensures reliability, scalability, and fault-tolerance. The system is designed to be deployed and managed on Kubernetes.

🚀 Features
Asynchronous Task Processing: Offload long-running tasks from your main application thread to improve responsiveness and user experience.

High Throughput: Leverages Apache Kafka's high-performance messaging capabilities to handle a large volume of tasks.

Scalability: Designed to scale horizontally. You can add more consumer instances to handle increased load.

Fault-Tolerance: Ensures that tasks are not lost in case of a worker failure. Redis is used to track task state, and Kafka provides message durability.

Distributed Architecture: Components are decoupled and can run on different machines or containers.

Kubernetes-Ready: Comes with Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files for easy deployment and management in a cloud-native environment.

🏛️ Architecture
The system consists of three main components:

Producers: Applications that create tasks and send them to a Kafka topic.

Kafka Cluster: A distributed streaming platform that acts as the message broker, decoupling producers from consumers.

Consumers (Workers): A group of services that subscribe to the Kafka topic, process the tasks, and update the task status in Redis.

Redis: An in-memory data store used to track the status and results of tasks, providing fast access to job metadata.

Workflow:

A Producer serializes a task object and sends it to the task-queue Kafka topic.

Kafka receives the message and stores it durably, making it available to consumers.

A Consumer instance from the consumer group polls Kafka for new messages.

Upon receiving a task, the Consumer updates its status to IN_PROGRESS in Redis.

The Consumer executes the task.

After completion, the Consumer updates the task's status to COMPLETED or FAILED in Redis and stores the result.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for the producer and consumer applications.

Apache Kafka: For building a real-time, distributed messaging backbone.

Redis: For task state management and storing results.

Docker: For containerizing the applications.

Kubernetes: For orchestrating and managing the containerized application components.

Maven: For project build and dependency management.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java 11 or higher

Maven

Docker

Minikube or a Kubernetes cluster

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://your-git-repo/nexusq.git
cd nexusq

2. Build the Applications
Build the producer and consumer JAR files using Maven.

# Build Producer
cd producer
mvn clean package

# Build Consumer
cd ../consumer
mvn clean package

3. Build Docker Images
Create Docker images for the producer and consumer applications.

# Build Producer Image
docker build -t nexusq-producer:latest ./producer

# Build Consumer Image
docker build -t nexusq-consumer:latest ./consumer

4. Deploy to Kubernetes
Deploy the entire system stack to your Kubernetes cluster.

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

This will deploy Kafka, Zookeeper, Redis, and the NexusQ producer and consumer applications.

5. Submitting a Task
You can submit a task by sending a request to the producer service or by running the producer application directly.

6. Checking Task Status
The status of a task can be retrieved by querying Redis using the task ID.

📄 API Reference (Example)
Submit a new task
POST /tasks

Request Body:

{
  "taskType": "EMAIL_SEND",
  "payload": {
    "to": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Hello from NexusQ!",
    "body": "This is an asynchronous email."
  }
}

Response:

{
  "taskId": "uuid-1234-abcd-5678",
  "status": "QUEUED"
}

Get task status
GET /tasks/{taskId}

Response:

{
  "taskId": "uuid-1234-abcd-5678",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "result": {
    "deliveryStatus": "SENT"
  }
}
